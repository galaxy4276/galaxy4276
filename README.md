I enjoy learning a wide range of technologies in the web space.
I'm interested in how to best utilize Node.js, Java/Kotlin Spring backend technologies and testing, and React.js/Next.js.
I strive to be a T-shaped person, which refers to having a general knowledge base but being highly specialized in specific areas.
I'm on my way to becoming a backend developer who can handle a lot of communication with as few resources as possible.
